## About the game

This game is an endless runner game. The player has to jumps over several a gap between two landing platforms.

For the player to continue with his endless journey, he has to jump over each fireball that he meets on his in addition to jumping to cross the gaps between the landing platforms.

### How to Play

The game is basically controlled using the click function of any clicking device of the computer. This can be the touch pad, mouse and other related device.

As the character starts running, every click makes the character to jump. Double clicking lets the character jumps as twice higher as a single click.

## Game Design & Development

To get started with the development of the project and considering how all the tools needed to build a working simple game like an endless runner. I had to first learn about video games and the basics of Phaser Game Library.

I also learnt create the game template using the a tutorial from [Zenva](https://phasertutorials.com/creating-a-phaser-3-template-part-3/)

### The design process

The game design took a simple storyline. It is a single player game with having only one character.

There are six scenes in the game - preloader scene, login scene, menu scene, options scene, leader board scene and game-play scene.

* All the game's assets load in the preloader scene.
* In the login scene, the player inputs  a username that would be used to display his scores in the leader board scene.
* The menu scene displays a list of buttons that send the user to other scenes/sub-menus. These include buttons to start and play the game, button to display the leader board and the like.
* The options scene allows the player to toggle the sound bits of the game.
* The leader board scene displays the first three highest scores from all the players who have ever played the game.
The scores are stored in using [LeaderBoard API Service](https://www.notion.so/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3).
* The game scene is where the actual game-play takes place. It's a simple mountain scene with blocks of different lengths positioned at various heights. The runner would jump and land on each block and also make sure that the incoming fireball does not crash him wiles running and jumping. The player is only rewarded only by catching the coins sees on the way.
